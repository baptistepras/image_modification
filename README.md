# Image Modification

This project takes an image and applies modifications to it. Modifications can be filters, rotating, scaling etc... This project was made during my first year of university.

# How to use it

Just run the file `filters.py`. Explore this file to find which functions you can call on your image.

A puppy image is given as example, but you can use any image. When you call a function on your image, the new image will be saved in the src repository.
